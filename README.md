Deadlines for iOS is a powerful Task Management application created by Shiv Sakhuja.

Features:
- Reminds you with a notification at the 24 hour mark and the 2 hour mark before a task's deadline: The perfect amount of time to finish any job.
- Intelligently recognizes tasks such as 'Call' or 'Email' and displays the appropriate button to conveniently help you finish such tasks.
- Extend the deadline of a task by 24 hours
- Assign a task to someone else. (Currently allows assign by email, we're working on adding social task assignment via Facebook)
- Keeps track of completed tasks as well, so you can review them later
